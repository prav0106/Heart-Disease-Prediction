# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction 🏥

## 📝 Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** using Machine Learning. The model analyzes patient health parameters to determine the likelihood of heart disease. The dataset used consists of multiple features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing and Cleaning  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Machine Learning Model Training  
✅ Model Evaluation and Accuracy Analysis  
✅ Interactive Prediction  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook/ Colab
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (for ML models)

## 🔧 Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook/ Colab
- Required Python Libraries (Install using the command below)

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 📂 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

## 🏃 Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the `Heart Disease Detection Code.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the steps to load the dataset, preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

## 📈 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are used for performance visualization.
