# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction 🏥

## 📝 Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** using Machine Learning. The model analyzes patient health parameters to determine the likelihood of heart disease. The dataset used consists of multiple features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing and Cleaning  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Machine Learning Model Training  
✅ Model Evaluation and Accuracy Analysis  
✅ Interactive Prediction  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📒 Google Colab
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (for ML models)

## 🔧 Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a Google account and access to Google Colab.

### 📂 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

## 🏃 Usage
1. Open Google Colab and upload the `Heart Disease Detection Code.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load the dataset
   - Preprocess the data
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate performance
   - Make predictions

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in [Here](heart_disease_data Dataset.csv).

## 📈 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are used for performance visualization.
